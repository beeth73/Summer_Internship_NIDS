This repository contains the complete project for an intelligent **Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)** developed as part of a summer internship at **Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited (ONGC), Mumbai**. The project leverages a comprehensive machine learning pipeline to classify network traffic as either "Benign" or "Attack" using the UNSW-NB15 dataset.

## üìñ Project Overview

In today's digital landscape, traditional signature-based intrusion detection systems often fail to detect novel and polymorphic (zero-day) attacks. This project addresses this critical security gap by building a data-driven NIDS that learns from network patterns to identify threats. The entire workflow, from data ingestion to model evaluation, is documented in the `hope.ipynb` notebook.

## üìä Data Source

The dataset used for this project is the **UNSW-NB15 dataset**, created by the Cyber Range Lab of the Australian Centre for Cyber Security (ACCS). It is widely used as a benchmark for evaluating NIDS performance.

The raw CSV files (`UNSW-NB15_1.csv`, `UNSW-NB15_2.csv`, `UNSW-NB15_3.csv`, `UNSW-NB15_4.csv`) and the `NUSW-NB15_features.csv` file were downloaded from the official source provided by UNSW Sydney:

## üéØ Problem Statement

The core challenge was to design and implement a machine learning pipeline capable of accurately classifying network traffic on the complex, high-dimensional, and severely imbalanced **UNSW-NB15 dataset**. The system needed to effectively distinguish between normal traffic and a wide range of modern cyberattacks, overcoming the limitations of static, rule-based systems.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Features & Methodology

The project followed a structured, end-to-end data science lifecycle designed for efficiency and performance on consumer-grade hardware.

1.  **Data Preprocessing:**
    *   Merged four raw CSV files into a single DataFrame of over 2.5 million records.
    *   Cleaned the data by dropping irrelevant columns, removing over **490,000 duplicate records**, and correcting data types.
    *   Applied **log transformation** to normalize skewed numerical features.

2.  **Feature Engineering & Selection:**
    *   **Limited the cardinality** of high-variance categorical features (like `service`) to prevent memory errors during encoding.
    *   Trained a **RandomForest** model on a stratified sample of the data to calculate feature importances.
    *   Selected the **top 66 most predictive features** to reduce dimensionality and improve model efficiency.

3.  **Class Imbalance Handling:**
    *   Systematically compared two key strategies:
        1.  Training models on the imbalanced data using model-native parameters (`scale_pos_weight`).
        2.  Training models on a perfectly balanced dataset created using **SMOTE** (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).

4.  **Comparative Model Evaluation:**
    *   Trained and benchmarked four distinct classifiers: **Logistic Regression, RandomForest, XGBoost, and LightGBM**.
    *   Evaluated all 8 scenarios (4 models x 2 strategies) on a held-out test set using metrics like Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC AUC.

## üèÜ Final Results & Conclusion

The comprehensive analysis revealed clear trade-offs between detection rates, false alarms, and training speed.

-   **Best Detection Rate (Lowest False Negatives):** The **LightGBM (No SMOTE)** model proved to be the most vigilant, missing only 26 out of ~64,000 attacks in the test set.
-   **Best Balance (Highest F1-Score):** The **RandomForest (No SMOTE)** model achieved the best balance of Precision and Recall.
-   **Recommended Overall Model:** The **RandomForest (With SMOTE)** model was identified as the best overall solution from the analysis, offering an excellent combination of high detection rates and reliability.

This project underscores the power of tree-based ensembles for intrusion detection and highlights the critical importance of selecting a model based on specific security priorities.
